no management effort is sufficient if you don't know where you go or changing it too frequently
including having too broad goals/ambitions without sufficient resources
hiring focus; selling unfocused company to candidates - leads to overselling
people comfortable with uncertainty - good at exploration stage, not so good at company growth
